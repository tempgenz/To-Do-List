# To-Do-List
my first project as a beginner just a To-Do-Listto add and manage tasks
you can add tasks to the list view them if there are 1 or more
remove them change there status to complete or pending or vise versa 
when you add a task its saved as pending by default coz obviously why would you add 
a task as completed if its already completed :)
edge cases have been handled while the input is given and
make sure to install tabulate and csv before running the program
